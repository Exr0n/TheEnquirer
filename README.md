# Yoy. How goes it?

I'm TheEnquirer, also know as, well, just Enquirer (and sometimes Abstract Giraffe.) 

I'm a highschooler in the Bay Area, an avid (neo)vim user, and more importantly, someone who loves to make things. Coding is one of the ways I pursue that love, and that's what github is here for! 


Some non-private repos and projects you can check out are 

- 📋 [#!/Shabang | Condution](www.condution.com): Awesome Checklist App for Humans and Aliens Alike w/ @zbuster05 @Exr0n @ban-ionic-ohms @Jemoka 
- ⚙️ [My Config](https://github.com/TheEnquirer/config): It's very good :)
- 🌱 [Taproot](https://github.com/SkoolNotes/Taproot): My Noteking system I built with some friends 

*And alot more, coming soon!*
